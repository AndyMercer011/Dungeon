README Assignment 1.10



using sheaffer's code, adding up the range attack, limited to time I couldn't make my own game. The holy grenade will destory 
every monster inside the dungeon, and normal range weapon will get only one monster.

press r to enter into aimming mode, you might see more cells when you "concentrate" on a direction, like the sniping mode in FPS
next, press r to shoot one enemy, press s to throw your spell---fire ball!, and press R to throw the holy grenade, wipe out every npc
except yourself---just like that bomb in <Player one>, hope you enjoy it.
